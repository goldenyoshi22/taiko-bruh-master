# taiko bruh master
## a web port of taiko, without any copyright
*what if taiko and BMS combined?*

### features
- both taiko and bms-styled gauges, (there is Gauge Auto-Shift too)
- quite a bit of songs that can range from very easy to nearly impossible
- simple UI (though may not be the easiest to figure out controls at first)
